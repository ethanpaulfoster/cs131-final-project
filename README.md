Welcome to my CS131 Final Project: Diving into Computer Vision: Using Computer Vision to Extract Springboard Diving Information

My code should be working so that you can step through Demo.ipynb to see my project and how I am able to estimate a diver's height, distance, and position in the air using computer vision methods such as calibration, projection, object tracking, pose estimation, and neural networks.
Make sure you install ultralytics and openCV and any other necessary dependencies to allow Demo.ipynb to work. I have also included 3 videos to show my progress throughout the project. "105b.mov" shows a clip of a diver performing a dive. "105b_Tracking.mov" includes the person detection and tracking using YOLOv8 by Ultralytics. "105b_All_Predictions.mov" includes the position, height, and distance computations as completed by Demo.ipynb.
